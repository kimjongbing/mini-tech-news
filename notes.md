# Planning

Website will call two APIs:
1. Hackernews
2. Lobsters

For these APIs, use the techurls.com API.https://techurls.com/api/get_titles
Need to possibly create my own API endpoint that crafts specific requests and then feeds it to techurl and then gets the result and sends it to my site.

Call one rss feed:
1. Talkback https://talkback.sh/resources/feed/news/
